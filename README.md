# README

I had to restart roughly 4 times do to me messing around with the schema and not learning my lesson. After I broke my application, I used my original code (which was cars and repairs then changed it to skateshop and skateshop_items, then to foods and ingredients, to finally retail stores and items. copying from my original code from google docs that I have been copying and pasting in, was a terrible idea due to me staying up late and forgetting to rename everything...also pasting it into the wrong files was an issue. refactoring was insane, 10/10 won't do it again)
